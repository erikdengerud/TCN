# Electricity

This folder contains the experiments on the electricity dataset. 

## Data

The data comes from the authors of the [DeepGLO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03806.pdf) paper. It can be downloaded using the script `download_data.sh` in the `data` folder.

The electricity dataset is part of the UCI archive [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ElectricityLoadDiagrams20112014).
It contains the electricity consumption for 370 clients/houses in the period from 2011 to 2014.
The data is in the form of averages over 15 minutes intervals, but it is used as 1 hour intervals in DeepGLO and other papers.
